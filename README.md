# 🚀 Cognizant Hackathon 2025 – AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing

This repository contains our project for the **Cognizant Hackathon 2025**, where our team developed an **AI-powered dynamic pricing system**.  
The system automatically adjusts product prices in real-time using **sales history, demand forecasts, competitor pricing, and inventory data**.
