🚀 Cognizant Hackathon 2025 – AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing

This repository contains our project for the Cognizant Hackathon 2025, where our team developed an AI-powered dynamic pricing system. The system automatically adjusts product prices in real-time using sales history, demand forecasts, competitor pricing, and inventory data.

📌 Problem Statement

Traditional static pricing fails to capture fast-changing customer behavior and market trends, leading to lost revenue and competitiveness.

🎯 Our Solution

We built an AI-driven dynamic pricing engine that:

Analyzes sales history, competitor trends, and demand forecasts.

Applies machine learning models (Regression, Reinforcement Learning, Time Series Forecasting).

Suggests real-time price adjustments to maximize revenue and market share.

Provides a visualization dashboard to monitor price trends and demand.

🔑 Features

📊 Data-Driven Insights – Sales, inventory, and competitor analysis.

🤖 ML Models – Regression, Time Series, Reinforcement Learning.

⚡ Dynamic Pricing Engine – Real-time recommendations.

📈 Visualization Dashboard – Interactive graphs for trends.

🌍 Scalable Design – Works across multiple categories and domains.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
